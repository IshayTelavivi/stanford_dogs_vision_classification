# stanford_dogs_vision_classification
The project was the practice of the MDLI computer vision course, delivered by the the [MDLI forum](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MDLI1/)  leaders. The purpose of the course is to learn the foundations of deep-learning, specifically computer vision, and is purely based on the Stanford cs321..(link).

The project was done with my course coleague Michael Mendelboim (link Github).

The dataset we used was the Stanford Dogs... (link), that includes 120 different classes (breeds), and also has labels for object detection boxes. Initially we planned to do the project in two phases: first pure classification and then object-detection. However eventially the object-detection phase was not  completed, but we do have the basics done.

Our aim was to experiment as many features as poosible, for example:
- monitoring ...system (we used the Nuptune.ai platform)
- pre-trained models
- Early stopping
- Trying out various parameters
- Trying out various augmentaitons
- .... (look inside the notebooks)

The classifications folder contains the following notebooks:

The object_detection folder contains one notebook:
